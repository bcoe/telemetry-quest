## Plot

* Deployed the feature of the year, to meet shareholder value.
    * Tweets suggest the deployment isn't working well.
        * You must add error tracking.
        * Logging
        * Tracing.

### Chapter 1: Error Logging

* Not awake enough to update the application:
    * Failure: try to update the website any ways, the entire thing melts down.
    * Solution:
        * Coffee machine
            * Problem: Coffee machine is missing coffee filters
                * Solution: Convenience store down street has coffee filters.
                    * Required: Wallet, which can be found at your desk.
                * Problem: Can't leave office to get coffee filters while all hands is happening.
                    * Solution: Go into server room and reset router.
                        * Problem: Head of IT won't let people in the server room.
                            * Hints: Talk to head of IT, he mentions something about people using the wrong type of paper.
                            * Solution: 
                                * Pick up "Double-Sided Heavyweight Gloss Digital C2S Cardstock"
                                * Place paper in printer - Are you sure? this is likely to jam.
                                * Hint: IT person now no longer at desk.
    * Check point: Buy filters drink coffee.
        *  Deploy website with error tracking.
    * Cut scene, using Sentry to identify errors, but oh no, there's still complaints about problems on Twitter.
