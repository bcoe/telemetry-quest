* Mark: a very senior backend engineer.

## Opening

You pushed out what might be the most important update the website has
ever seen on Friday.

Things aren't looking good. Over the weekend there were several angry
posts from tech influencers. Login issues, slow to load pages, an undercurrent of unease is in the air.

Unfortunately, your legacy website lacks any telemetry. You don't have a clue what might be happening.

If you can't get this fixed by the end of the day, it might be the last feature you ever ship.

## Ending

Deploying the error tracking to your application is much easier than you expected.

Within minutes, you're able to see what errors were affecting your customers.

You're able to patch the problems, deploy a fix, and no rollback is necessary.

You've saved the day.

    * Failure: try to update the website any ways, the entire thing melts down.
    * Solution:
        * Coffee machine
            * Problem: Coffee machine is missing coffee filters
                * Solution: Convenience store down street has coffee filters.
                    * Required: Wallet, which can be found at your desk.

                        * Problem: Head of IT won't let people in the server room.
                            * Hints: Talk to head of IT, he mentions something about people using the wrong type of paper.
                            * Solution: 
                                * Pick up "Double-Sided Heavyweight Gloss Digital C2S Cardstock"
                                * Place paper in printer - Are you sure? this is likely to jam.
                                * Hint: IT person now no longer at desk.
    * Check point: Buy filters drink coffee.
        *  Deploy website with error tracking.

## Script

In the early 1990s, Sierra adventure games helped me fall in love with computers.

They were funy, challenging, and very sarcastic. Although the graphics seem archaic by today's standards, 
they were very emersive for an 8 year old.

For Hack week, I wanted to see how far I could get building a Sierra inspired adventure game in just
my cunning, a bunch LLM models, and a severe lack of sleep.

From this was born, "Telemetry Quest".


Telemetry Quest is a retro adventure game, exploring software instrumentation, and all the excitement this
space has to offer.

It has thrills, drama, action, and most importantly, software telemetry.
